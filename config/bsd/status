Comments:

	This configuration is for FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.
	For Darwin (Apple Macintosh), use the "macintosh" configuration.

	Building on OpenBSD produces unsuppressible linker warnings
	that urge the replacement of certain standard library functions.
	This has not been done.

	Tested 2017 on amd64 OpenBSD 6.2 using cc (clang) 5.0.0.
	Tested 2017 on amd64 OpenBSD 6.2 using gcc (GCC) 4.2.1.
